# Image Classification with CLIP

This repository contains the code and documentation for an image classification project utilizing the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model. The primary goal is to distinguish between images of cats and dogs, exploring the capabilities of CLIP in image classification tasks.

## Project Overview

### Introduction

This project focuses on image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model is utilized for this purpose.

### Instructors
- **Dr. Caroline**
- **Nouran Khaled**
- **Aya Abdullah**

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset of cat and dog images used for training and testing.
- **Cats&Dogs_Pics**: Original images of cats and dogs for reference.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **results**: Visualizations and results from the project, including confusion matrices and similarity matrices.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages for running the code.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and run the following notebooks in sequence:

    - `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Explore the dataset and preprocess data.
    - `02_model_training.ipynb`: Train the CLIP model for image classification.
    - `03_results_visualization.ipynb`: Visualize project results, including confusion matrices and similarity matrices.

## Results

1. **Project Overview**: A summary of key project results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
2. **Visualizations**: Explore the `results` directory for visualizations such as confusion matrices and similarity matrices.
